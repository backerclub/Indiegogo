This is a huge achievement and we couldn’t have done it without you! \n\nTo meet our deadline, we’ve split production into two parts. Part 1 is the textile component of the BioVYZR (production underway). Part 2 is the hardware components for the air purification system (production to start shortly). This approach takes advantage of the fact that the hardware isn’t built into the visor. This way it can be easily assembled afterward.\n\nExactly one month ago we launched the BioVYZR 1.0 as a prototype. Since then, we’ve been in touch with hundreds of our backers, listening to your feedback and insights. It has influenced us to make some major improvements to our prototype. These are upgrades that we felt would be critical to your safety and comfort. \n\nBefore I get into it, I want to highlight the fact that the majority of our backers are healthcare professionals (thank you nurses, anesthesiologists, paramedics, dentists, surgeons, and staff!). Their feedback has been (and will be) instrumental in helping us ensure that our product is as effective as possible. Where we initially planned to produce a separate Medical BioVYZR, we’ve decided instead to make all BioVYZRs capable of handling the demands of healthcare professionals. \n\nTo keep it short, I will list the 5 key upgrades you can expect in your BioVYZR:\n\n1. A (much) more powerful air filtration system  \n\n2. An incredibly durable exterior surface material (medical-grade)\n\n3. A simplified filter replacement mechanism (one standard size)\n\n4. Added comfort for daily travel \u0026amp; journeys (hydration, windows, and pockets)\n\n5. Sterile Drapes \n\nWith these upgrades, all BioVYZRs have been optimized for the healthcare environment. These upgrades will greatly enhance the effectiveness and experience of wearing the visor. We've posted an in-depth overview to our blog with more details: https://www.vyzrtech.com/blogs/news/upgrading-the-biovyzr-1-0-what-you-can-expect\n\nWhat do all these changes mean for our production deadline? \n\nMaking these improvements has added 2 extra prototypes to our product development cycle and restrictions on travel to China have slowed our prototyping process. Our initial delivery range was between May 30th and June 15th. From our vantage point, that range will realistically shift to June 12th - June 30th. \n\nYou're the first to get this information and we'll be updating our campaign page and website to reflect these changes. If you have any questions, you can always reach us at care@vyzrtech.com or talk to Erin on our website's chat window.\n\nStay safe and well, \n\nYezin A.",

          "text": "Happy Friday everyone, \n\nWe just wanted to send out a short update to get everyone on the same page. \n\n \n\nWHOA! 800 Backers!!\n\nWow, everyone, we've gotten to 800 backers. Honestly, we're always surprised and grateful by the amount of support our projects receive from the IGG and KS community. It's genuinely so much fun to get to design products for all of you guys, and it's even better to know that a lot of you are people that have backed our other projects before. So I'd like to say thank you to everyone that's supporting this project; you all rock, and we appreciate the love. \n\n \n\nHere's a link to do the Pre-Survey\n\nNow, I'm sure most of you realized that we didn't ask you what size, style, or color you'd like to receive. Well, that is because we wanted to wait till the campaign had reached halfway before we sent out a survey to see what styles, sizes, and colors we should have as options. \n\nSo, since we're nearing halfway, click here to do the pre-survey.\n\nThis survey isn't the final survey where you get to pick what your unique shipment will have, but rather, this survey will help us make sure we have the most popular options available for you to choose from at the end.\n\n \n\nGetting production-ready\n\nDue to the coronavirus, all production has been a nightmare; our bedsheets (Jax Sheets) has been late by months, we are running out of shirts, and, until last week, we couldn't even get self-cleaning masks made for our customers. With all the uncertainty, we want to start production as soon as possible. So, after we receive the results from the survey above, we're going to do our best to get production-ready, so that we don't have to be stuck in production hell like every other project. \n\n \n\nName changed from Fjord to Kribi\n\nWhen we were working on this project, it gained the codename Fjord because a Fjord is defined as a deep inlet of the sea between high cliffs. This made us think of a butt (I know, we're strange), so we worked with that name for a while. Well, it turns out, if you're decently good at Googling things, you'll find a British company that sells Fjord underwears too. So, to make everyone's lives easier (and not to get sued), we changed the underwear name from Fjord to Kribi. Kribi is a beach town in Cameroon that I've always wanted to visit, but also, if you look at a map of Cameroon, it looks like it's on the butt of the country, so we figured Kribi works as the new name. \n\n \n\nOn the personal side of things\n\nHey everyone, if you don't know me, my name is Wen. I am the founder of HercLéon, and I lead most of the material research and product testing. I love materials and enjoy sharing what I know about materials with those who are interested, so if you'd like to learn more, need help picking materials (sheets, shirts, etc.), or want to chat, please feel free to email me. My life goal is to help people reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible, so we as a society can live a sustainable life.\n\nNevertheless, I do want to thank you for supporting this project, and I look forward to hearing how you like your new underwear. \n\n \n\nWhat to do now? \n\nTake pre-survey by clicking here\n\nEmail me with any questions or if you just want to say hello\n\nHave a wonderful weekend",

So, after we receive the results from the survey above, we're going to do our best to get production-ready, so that we don't have to be stuck in production hell like every other project.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003eName changed from Fjord to Kribi\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003eWhen we were working on this project, it gained the codename Fjord because a Fjord is defined as a deep inlet of the sea between high cliffs. This made us think of a butt (I know, we're strange), so we worked with that name for a while. Well, it turns out, if you're decently good at Googling things, you'll find a British company that sells Fjord underwears too. So, to make everyone's lives easier (and not to get sued), we changed the underwear name from Fjord to Kribi. Kribi is a beach town in Cameroon that I've always wanted to visit, but also, if you look at a map of Cameroon, it looks like it's on the butt of the country, so we figured Kribi works as the new name.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003eOn the personal side of things\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"\u003eHey everyone, if you don't know me, my name is Wen.

If you have purchased the DHL express shipping, you can expect to receive your HarmonicDyne Helios headphone within the next 5 - 8 business days. For standard shipping, please kindly allow 10 - 30 days for the arrival, particularly considering the impact of COVID-19.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, we have received many feedbacks and inquiries regarding the headphone case. We sincerely apologise that we didn’t manage to update the last-minute change to you. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, the factories couldn’t fulfil the headphone case orders. To ship the Helios to you as soon as possible, we have to make the change at the very last minute. To extend our apologies, we will provide a $10 Linsoul gift card to every HarmonicDyne Helios backer. \n\n \n\nAs always, please feel free to reach out at Linsoultech@gmail.com if you have any questions.\n\n \n\nThanks so much for your understanding and support!\n\n \n\nStay tuned!\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nHarmonicDyne and Linsoul Team",

This brought all the efforts to a halt. The factory workers are just now slowly returning back to work but they are very behind on their projects and have limited capabilities.  It is with a broken heart that I need to inform our supporters that unfortunately, because of the coronavirus, we will not be delivering the Pop Up Pet Door 2.0 for several months. \n\nWe understand that many of you will be disappointed.  We are too. As many of you know, we have been selling version 1.0 for over a year and have thousands of very satisfied customers in 38 Countries. Version 1.0 has features that our customers love that 2.0 does not have.  Including, it can easily be modified to fit nearly every 80” or shorter sliding door or window and is simply attached with a strip of velcro. “Pop it up when you need it and take it down and completely lock your door” for your safety.  Pop Up Pet Door 1.0 was featured on Animal Planet, Hallmark Channel, GodTV, Good Day Utah, CityLine, Fox 5 Las Vegas, Fox 8 in San Diego, Pet Products Magazine and many others. We would like to offer to send you our Version 1.0 now so that you don’t have to wait any longer and when 2.0 is available, we will provide you with a code to buy version 2.0 at a huge discount.  \n\nYou can simply respond by emailing me at ThePetDoor@Gmail.Com and let me know what Address you would like us to use to ship you our Version 1.0 and what size you would like us to send.  You can check out the different sizes on PopUpPetDoor.Com OR you can simply just keep your order for version 2.0 and we will send it to you when it becomes available.  \n\nAgain, thank you for your support and understanding as we keep pressing on during this difficult time,\n\nRenee",
